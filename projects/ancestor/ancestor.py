    # Write a function that, given the dataset and the ID of an individual in the dataset, 
    # returns their earliest known ancestor â€“ the one at the farthest distance from the input 
    # individual. If there is more than one ancestor tied for "earliest", return the one with 
    # the lowest numeric ID. If the input individual has no parents, the function should return -1.

    # Then search the graph for the farthest common ancestor

                # we store the path(3) 
                    # Correct for path(3) is (3, 1, 10)
                    # path(3) then has another branching path(3,2)
                # and path(5) separately and then compare it at the end
